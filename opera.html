    <h2>The Gondoliers</h2>
    <h3>
    ACT II
        SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
   Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
   occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
   are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
   etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
 degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
   distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
   reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.
    </h3>
 
                CHORUS OF MEN with MARCO and GIUSEPPE.
 
             Of happiness the very pith
                            In Barataria you may see:
             A monarchy that's tempered with
                            Republican Equality.
             This form of government we find
             The beau ideal of its kind—
             A despotism strict combined
                            With absolute equality!
 
                          MARCO and GIUSEPPE.
 
             Two kings, of undue pride bereft,
                            Who act in perfect unity,
             Whom you can order right and left
                            With absolute impunity.
             Who put their subjects at their ease
             By doing all they can to please!
             And thus, to earn their bread-and-cheese,
                            Seize every opportunity.
 
   <h4>CHO.</h4>   Of happiness the very pith, etc.
 
   <h4>MAR.</h4>      Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your
             expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much
             obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good
             feeling.
  <h4> ALL.</h4>      We heard you.
   <h4>MAR.</h4>      We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with
             sentiments so charmingly expressed.
  <h4> ALL.</h4>      That's all right.
   <h4>GIU.</h4>      At the same time there is just one little grievance
             that we should like to ventilate.
  <h4>ALL (angrily). </h4> What?
  <h4>GIU.</h4>       Don't be alarmed—it's not serious.  It is arranged
             that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we
             are to act as one person.
  <h4>GIO.</h4>   Exactly.
  <h4>GIU. </h4>      Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point
             of fact, two persons.
  <h4>ANN.</h4>  Ah, I don't think we can go into that.  It is a
             legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things.  Situated as
             we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.
  <h4>GIU. </h4>     No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.
             It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you
             supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it
             as a legal fiction carried a little too far.
  <h4>ANN.</h4>      It's rather a nice point.  I don't like to express an
             opinion off-hand.  Suppose we reserve it for argument before the
             full Court?
 <h4> MAR.</h4>       Yes, but what are we to do in the meantime?
 MAR. and GIU.  We want our tea.
  ANNI.      I think we may make an interim order for double
             rations on their Majesties entering into the usual undertaking to
             indemnify in the event of an adverse decision?
 GIOR.       That, I think, will meet the case.  But you must work
             hard—stick to it—nothing like work.
  GIU.       Oh, certainly.  We quite understand that a man who
             holds the magnificent position of King should do something to
             justify it.  We are called "Your Majesty"; we are allowed to buy
             ourselves magnificent clothes; our subjects frequently nod to us
             in the streets; the sentries always return our salutes; and we
             enjoy the inestimable privilege of heading the subscription lists
             to all the principal charities.  In return for these advantages
             the least we can do is to make ourselves useful about the Palace.
